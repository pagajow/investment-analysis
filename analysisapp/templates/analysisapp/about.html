    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>
        This application is designed to support individual investors in analyzing and evaluating investment assets, with a strong focus on publicly traded company stocks. It aims to simplify and streamline the process of storing financial statement data, creating personal notes for each asset, comparing companies, estimating intrinsic value, and assessing fundamental metrics clearly and effectively.

    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <p>
        Users can enter and store key financial data from annual reports, along with personal notes related to each analyzed financial asset. The application enables visualization of this data through interactive charts and diagrams, while also allowing users to define their own evaluation criteria to assess a company's financial health. Additionally, it automatically calculates relevant financial ratios and indicators based on the user's input, providing a quick and intuitive overview of a company's fundamental attractiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        A basic discounted cash flow (DCF) calculator is available to help estimate a company's intrinsic value based on future cash flows.

        For users who supply both an OpenAI API key and a Google Search API key, an integrated AI assistant powered by the "GPT-4o mini" model is available. This assistant generates simplified research summaries and reports based on stored data, uploaded PDF or text files, and questions provided by the user. If necessary, the assistant will also conduct relevant online searches to supplement its analysis. This functionality accelerates research processes related to company reports and market documents. Reports generated by the AI assistant are stored for later review and reference.

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
        This application was created to speed up and simplify the analysis of financial assets. I am its first and primary user, and its features are deeply inspired by my own needs and experience as a developer and investor. Over time, I plan to expand its capabilities. I sincerely hope others find it equally useful, making their research process smoother and more enjoyable.
